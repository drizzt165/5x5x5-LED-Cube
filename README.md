# Description:
This project was based off various similar projects that can be found all over the internet, but with some additions and changes I wanted to make. The process started during winter break after the Fall 2018 semester and finished a few months later as I worked on it whenever I wasn't bogged down by course work. 

The project features 125 individually addressable LED's soldered together with tinned copper wire. Aesthetically, this wire is pleasing but it does pose the risk of easily shorting and causing some LED's explode; however, this is a rare occurrence and won't happen unless it is being heavily tinkered with during operation. I have been also attempting to setup up an app to be able to control the animations via Bluetooth but have not been able to get to working quite to my standard yet.
